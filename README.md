# Digital-Lock-System
This repository contains the design and implementation of a hardware-based security system built entirely using 74LS Series TTL Integrated Circuits. Unlike microcontroller-driven projects, this lock utilizes discrete logic to handle encoding, magnitude comparison, and sequential data storage.
