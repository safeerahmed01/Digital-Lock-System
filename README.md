This repository contains the design and implementation of a hardware-based security system built entirely using 74LS Series TTL Integrated Circuits. Unlike microcontroller-driven projects, this lock utilizes discrete logic to handle encoding, magnitude comparison, and sequential data storage.🛠️ System ArchitectureThe project demonstrates a complete digital logic pipeline:Decimal-to-BCD Encoding: A 74LS147 Priority Encoder converts 10-button keypad inputs into 4-bit Binary Coded Decimal (BCD).Data Conditioning: A 74LS04 Hex Inverter standardizes the active-low signals, while an RC network ($10\text{k}\Omega$ resistor + $0.1\mu\text{F}$ capacitor) provides hardware debouncing to eliminate mechanical switch noise.Storage & Comparison: The 74LS195 shift register stores input digits, which the 74LS85 Magnitude Comparator then checks against a hard-wired "secret key".Memory Latching: Successful matches are captured by 74LS74 D-Type Flip-Flops. These latches ensure the "Match" state persists even after the user releases the keypad.⚡ Key Technical FeaturesHardware Debouncing: Strategic use of $0.1\mu\text{F}$ capacitors prevents the "double-clocking" error common in manual pulse circuits.Logic Stability: Pull-down resistors ($10\text{k}\Omega$) prevent floating inputs, and active-low pins ($\overline{CLR}$/$\overline{PRE}$) are tied to VCC to ensure stable operation.Visual Debugging: Integrated 74LS47 Decoder and 7-segment display for real-time BCD verification.📂 Repository ContentsSchematics: Proteus simulation files (.DSN) and PDF logic diagrams.Hardware: High-resolution photos of the multi-digit breadboard assembly.
